Lines:

	I see destruction; a path gauged through wooded land to transport electric, static, down metal wires, to an un-framed city.

The metal bars the touching of the sky â€“ interrupted
							By shocks
				Deadly.

	The observers [trees] stand in the shadow shaded by progress.

	The sky is full of anger.

	The observers [trees] curl and weep.

	The sky is full of anger.

	The observer [me, behind the camera] shivered at the loss of light, the growing darkness, and the path of progress.
